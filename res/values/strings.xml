        \n
       Give a fake-broadcast using 
        \n<b><i>"adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.PACKAGE_ADDED"</i></b>
        and you are ready to go.\n
        \n
        To know AudioStream you have to 
        print the mode once and see all the stream volumes.
        Change the volume again and then see which STREAM volume is changed using broadcast.
        That is the current active stream.
        Use tag <b>s@urav</b> to get logs.
